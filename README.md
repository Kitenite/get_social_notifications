# get_social_notifications
Use Selenium to get social media notifications. Use this so I don't have to check all my social medias for notifications.

## How to Use:

It's...complicated. You need Selenium installed, and a Chrome driver installed. 
Then, the first time it runs you need to sign into those platforms before it works. 
I could implement sign in with the driver but I can't be bothered. 

## Alternatives:

I had a different version of this using BeautifulSoup and Chrome cookies for signin. 
It worked for Facebook but Instagram end points returns some scripts and graph queries instead of HTML so it would need a browser to run, hence I chose Selenium.

## Support:
- Facebook
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
